# 🚗 Car Black Box (CBB)

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Car Black Box (CBB)** is a microcontroller-based embedded system designed to continuously monitor and log critical driving events for post-incident analysis. Inspired by black boxes used in aviation, this system is tailored for automotive environments to track anomalies such as **over-speeding**, **sudden braking**, or **system faults**.

The project uses a **PIC microcontroller (e.g., PIC18F4580)** and peripherals like potentiometers (as analog input sources), and stores event data into **EEPROM** for non-volatile logging.

## 🚦 Key Features
- Real-time monitoring of driving conditions
- Detection and logging of events like over-speeding
- Event logging in EEPROM with timestamps (if RTC is added)
- Peripheral interaction using ADC (e.g., speed simulation via potentiometer)
- Efficient interrupt-based system design
- Can be extended for GPS, crash sensor, or communication modules
